# noya-haikyuu-website

This website is one of the projects assigned in The Odin Project, where a static website is created using the lessons from the past HTML and CSS lessons offered by TOP. I decided to make a Nishinoya Yuu themed website since he's one of my favorite anime characters!

The images used in this website are from Haruichi Furudate, the creator of Haikyuu! and Production I.G., the producers of the manga's anime adaptation.
